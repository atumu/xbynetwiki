#  Welcome to your new DokuWiki 

Congratulations, your wiki is now up and running. Here are a few more tips to get you started.

Enjoy your work with DokuWiki,\\
-- the developers

##  Create your first pages 

Your wiki needs to have a start page. As long as it doesn't exist, this link will be red: [[:start]].

Go on, follow that link and create the page. If you need help with using the syntax you can always refer to the [syntax page](/pages/dokuwiki/wiki/syntax).

You might also want to use a sidebar. To create it, just edit the [FAQ on sidebars](/pages/dokuwiki/sidebar]] page. Everything in that page will be shown in a margin column on the side. Read our [[doku>faq/sidebar) to learn more.

Please be aware that not all templates support sidebars.

##  Customize your Wiki 

Once you're comfortable with creating and editing pages you might want to have a look at the [configuration settings](/pages/dokuwiki/this>doku.php?do=admin&page=config) (be sure to login as superuser first).

You may also want to see what [plugins](/pages/dokuwiki/doku>plugins) and [templates](/pages/dokuwiki/doku>templates) are available at DokuWiki.org to extend the functionality and looks of your DokuWiki installation.

##  Join the Community 

DokuWiki is an Open Source project that thrives through user contributions. A good way to stay informed on what's going on and to get useful tips in using DokuWiki is subscribing to the [[doku>newsletter]].

The [DokuWiki User Forum](http://forum.dokuwiki.org) is an excellent way to get in contact with other DokuWiki users and is just one of the many ways to get [support](/pages/dokuwiki/doku>faq/support).

Of course we'd be more than happy to have you [getting involved](/pages/dokuwiki/doku>teams/getting_involved) with DokuWiki.
